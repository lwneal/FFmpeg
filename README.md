FFplay Video Labeler
=============

This is a video labeling app hacked into a modified version of FFplay.

Build the labeler with `./build_labeler.sh` and run it with `python labeler.py`

Open any video file playable by FFplay, and label intervals of the file with the number keys 1 through 4.

Press 'q' or escape to quit ffplay and save the labels as a json text file.
